[Intro]
D   G   A  G
 
 
[Verse 1]
D                 G             A         F#m
It's a little bit funny,   this feeling inside
Bm             Bm/A       Bm/G#      G
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
D                  A        F#         Bm
I don't have much money, but boy, if I did
D             Em7        G               A
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
 
D             G       A                F#m
If I was a sculptor,   but then again, no
     Bm            Bm/A         Bm/G#      G
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
   D             A                 F#        Bm
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
D              Em7           G         D
My gift is my song, and this one's for you

[Chorus]
A                Bm        Em7          G
And you can tell everybody this is your song
A         Bm              Em             G
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
Bm                    Bm/A
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
Bm/G#              G
That I put down in words,
      D       Em            G             A
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
 
 
[Verse 2]
D             G       A                F#m
I sat on the roof     and kicked off the moss
        Bm          Bm/A              Bm/G#           G
Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
D                    A        F#                   Bm
But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
D                    Em7     G                A
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
 
D             G          A                F#m
So excuse me forgetting,   but these things I do
Bm               Bm/A              Bm/G#             G
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
D                  A                 F#     Bm
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
D               Em7        G              D
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
 
[Chorus]
A                Bm        Em7          G
And you can tell everybody this is your song
A         Bm              Em             G
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
Bm                    Bm/A
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
Bm/G#              G
That I put down in words,
      D       Em            G             A
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
 
Bm                   Bm/A
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
Bm/G#                G
That I put down in words,
     D/F#     Em            G             D       G   A   G   D
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
