[Verse 1]
C                 Dm    G         G7
I’m dreaming of a white Christmas,
F             Dm       G      C        Csus4  C
Just like the ones I used to know.
          C    Cmaj7   C7
Where the tree tops glisten,
    F        Fm
And children listen,
   C    Am                  Dm      G   G7
To hear sleigh bells in the snow.

May your days be merry and bright,
        C   Am   Dm      G      C
And may all your Christmases be white.
