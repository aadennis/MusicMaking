[Verse]
 
    E                   B7                               E
Hey Jude, don’t make it bad, take a sad song and make it better
  A                           E                   B7               E
Remember to let her into your heart, then you can start to make it better
 
    E               B7                                   E
Hey Jude, don’t be afraid, you were made to   go out and get her 
    A                             E              B7               E
The minute you let her under your skin, then you begin to make it better
 
[Chorus]
 
(E7)                     A         C#m      F#m         A         B7            
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain, don’t carry the world upon 
      E
your shoulders
E7                               A       C#m      F#m     A          B7           
  For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool by making his world a 
       E
little colder
 
[Interlude]
 
E        E7    B7
Na na na na na na na na

    E                   B7                                   E
Hey Jude, don’t let me down, you have found her,  now go and get her
  A                           E                   B7               E
Remember to let her into your heart, then you can start to make it better
 
[Chorus]
 
E7                         A       C#m     F#m         A           B7       
  So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin, you're waiting for someone 
      E
to perform with
E7                                  A        C#m          F#m     A            B7 
  And don’t you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do, the movement you 
B7               E
need is on your shoulder
 
E        E7    B7
Na na na na na na na na
 
[Verse]
 
    E                   B7                                E
Hey Jude, don’t make it bad, take a sad song  and make it better
  A                            E                B7              E
Remember to let her under your skin, then you begin to make it better
 

E        D           A                E
Na na na na na na na na na na na, hey Jude
(repeat that line, then mute D and A and ring on E...)
